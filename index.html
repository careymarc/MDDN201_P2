	<div><p>WEB-CHECK is a free to use application that people can use to check if a certain website is safe. This application can be used on mobile devices and can be a downloadable extension for your web browser. There will also be a website for users to go to if they don’t want to download the extension/application. The purpose of WEB-CHECK is to check how safe a website is. People can copy and paste a url of a website and input it in the bar. When the user presses the “enter” button, a gauge will below the bar. When the enter button has been pressed the gauge will indicate how safe the website is. The user will be able to tell by the gauge as it will have three colours, red, yellow and green. Green will mean that the website is safe and the user doesn’t have to worry about a thing. While yellow means that the website is not 100% safe, but the website is not the worst website out there. If the gauge is pointing towards the red section then that means that the website is not safe for the user. This website could potentially take the users data when they are browsing that website. Or they could infect their computer with a virus or other harmful stuff that could damage their computer. WEB-CHECK will be able to tell the user if the website could be doing this. Below the gauge will be some information into why the website is not safe. So depending on the website it could say that the users that interact with the website, their data gets taken and can used by other companies/people that will fine this data useful. Also this will make the user more aware when using websites from now on. Hopefully this product will be able to make people’s interaction with the internet more friendly and safe.

A company known as Cambridge Analytica harvested millions of people’s data on the social media platform FaceBook. In 2014 that built a system to target US voters and could predict their outcome. Also making advertisements personalised for every person. By doing this it affected the choices that people made and
impacted on the election. FaceBook has also been selling their users data to third
parties. Also on the internet there are hackers that may steal your information, such as credit card information or other personal information. WEB-CHECK will be able to check if that the websites your on could do any of these things. For the design aspect of it using primary colour will allow the user to identify the “good”, “average” and “bad” on the gauge. The colours for the gauge will be green, yellow and red. For the other parts of the gauge will have white, black and two different types of grey for the pointer/indicator. The background will be grey as the colours will not class with the primary and the indicator on the gauge. The input bar will be in white and next to the bar will be a blue button for when the user wants to check if they website is safe or not. The header font will be Noto Serif and the text font will be in Noto Sans JP. The icon will the gauge with a little rod connected to it. This will make it look like a magnifying glass. The downloadable application will also have this icon and it will have a blue background behind it.

<section>
 <div><p>WEB-CHECK’s target audience will be for anyone that wants to feel safe on the internet. So there is no specific age group
but however younger users of the internet aren’t usaully that
concerned about their safety while surfing the net. If they were to use it they would most likely download the app on the app store.Adults and older users of the internet are usaully more worried about their own safety, so they would most likely try to be safe while on theinternet. They may want to use this so that they don’t lose their personal information such as their personal data, credit card numbers and etc. So this age range might be more interested in the website version.

<div><p>The icon for the app will be similar to the gauge that will be used in the website/application. However the gauge is connected to a rod and with the use of that rod it will make it look like a magnifying glass. As if the magnifying glass will look over the websites. If its bad the indicator will point to the red section of the gauge.

<div><p>The fonts that will be used a Noto Serif and Noto Sans JP. The
font Noto Serif will be used as the header font. So this would be mainly seen as the top of a certain section of the website/app. The main text font will be Noto Sans JP. The two fonts look similar but they still have enough differences to telll the difference between the two. Also the font look professional and fit for purpose.

<div><p>The colour scheme for Web Check will consist of primary
colours, black, shades of grey and white. The use of the primary
colours will be used in the app logo/icon and the gauge itself. The red, yellow and green as used to tell if it is good, ok or bad. The blue is only used in the input bar and app icon for those who will download the app from the app store.

The monocolours are also apart of the icon. They will also be used in the website itself. As this will not allow the colours to clash with the primary colours on the gauge.

<div><p>The website would look
something like this. The point of this website is to checj if the
website you are visiting is safe.
So the website will be simplistic and straightforward. The white bar will be where the user will
enter the website url and then they would press the blue button with the black arrow to confirm their input. When the website has done its thing and checked how safe the website is then the gauge will move. The gauge will indicate how safe the website is. This will be displayed by the
colours and it will give some
information about why it is safe or not safe for you to use.

The interface will simple and easy to use just like the website
version of it. The gauge will tell you the result if the website is safe or not. This will happen when the user puts the url in the white
input bar and presses the blue enter button. This will also have a settings function as well and to get back to the main screen, the user just has to press the home icon.

<div><p>This is a advertisement that will be used to help promote the WEB-CHECK application/website. The best way to get people’s attention is to have a bright primary colour so that the eye will first see that. Then by having the blue text of WEB-CHECK will hopefully draw their attention after looking at the red alert sign.
